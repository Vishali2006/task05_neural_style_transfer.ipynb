# Neural Style Transfer

## Objective
To apply the artistic style of one image to the content of another using a pre-trained neural style transfer model.

## Model Used
Magenta Arbitrary Image Stylization (TensorFlow Hub)

## How It Works
The model extracts content features from one image and style features from another, then combines them to generate a stylized output.

## Tools
- TensorFlow
- TensorFlow Hub
- Google Colab (GPU)

## Result
Successfully transferred painting texture and color style to the content image.
